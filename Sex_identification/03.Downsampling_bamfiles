Downsampling bamfiles based on the number of reads

Results in /groups/hologenomics/andreaac/data/sex_identication/downsampling_bam

# To downsample bamfiles based on the number of reads you can use reformat from bbmap
# In this script we are downsampling multiple files with different number of reads and doing it for 5 replicates
# You need two files, one that calls the command bbMAP.sh for each individual sample and the bbMAP.sh file

#load modules for bbmap

module load htslib samtools
module load java
module load bbmap/v37.95

cat commands_bbmap_dog.txt | xsbatch -R -c 1 --time 1-00:00:00 --mem-per-cpu 5000 --

#bbMAP script includes the loop for the downsampling and the number of replicates
# src is the output directory, reformat.sh is the script from bbmap software and the other are the parameters for downsampling used in the name of the files
